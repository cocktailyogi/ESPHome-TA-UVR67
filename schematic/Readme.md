# DL-Bus Interface for KiCad

A bare minimum interface for connecting to the DL-Bus from **Technische Alternative**.

## 🎯 Overview

This KiCad project provides a simple hardware interface for communicating with DL-Bus devices. It has been tested with the UVR67 controller and has been running flawlessly for years.

## ⚠️ Warning

This design is intentionally kept as simple as possible, using components that were available at hand. **It does not include protection components against EMV (electromagnetic interference) or overvoltage.** Use at your own risk in non-critical applications.

## ✅ Tested Hardware

- **UVR67** - Multiple years of stable operation

## 📁 Project Contents

- KiCad schematic files
